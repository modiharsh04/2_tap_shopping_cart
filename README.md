# 2_tap_shopping_cart
Angular development.

Here I have developed a basic implementation of shopping cart with 2_tap_buy.

Here is the link to take a demo of app.
# link will be updated soon meanwhile you can try below steps

Instructions:

1. You need a server to run this application. I recommend web server for chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)
2. Once installed, open it (or any server) give your downloaded and extracted '2_tap_shopping_cart' folder as the source to your server and open localhost on server specified port.
